# Aging like fine Names

This project is based on the data provided by [Agify](https://agify.io/) on the mean age of people carrying a certain name.

**You can try it out on [GitHub Pages](https://mem96.github.io/aging-like-names/).**

I engaged in this project for at least two reasons:

1) To test my new skills in Vue.js
2) To try again with fetching API documentation, this time with Axios.

## How it works

Write a name on the input bar and find out the estimated age for that name and according on how many people.

You can also specify a country for a better estimation.

**Sidenote:** A small selection of coutries has been included, even though Agify provides data for a lot more.
That's because I was more interested in making the application work than in the overall usefulness of it.

When selecting <code>Any country</code> every nation I didn't include is taken into account as well.

## Credits

I didn't put very much effort on the styling, since this project is for personal satisfaction only.
